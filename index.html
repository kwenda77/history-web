                    Paris (nicknamed the "City of light") is the capital city of France, and the largest city in France. 
                    Paris is also the center of French economy, politics, traffic and culture. Paris has many art museums and historical buildings. 
                    As a traffic center, Paris has a very good underground subway system (called the Metro).

                    The language I would love to learn is French. First and foremost, learning French is the pleasure of learning a beautiful, rich, melodious language that is often called the language of love. 
                    French is also an analytical language that structures thought and develops critical thinking, which is a valuable skill for discussions and negotiations.
